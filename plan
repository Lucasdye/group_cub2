I) map parsing

- copy file.cub into copy_file
- Check for solo '\n' in map.
- copy the map from copy_file to copy_map and replace '\t' by 4 ' ' /!\ in creat_map.c
- Check if map i closed. The difficulty is to detect unclosed extern wall when it's
  located a j + 1 in the map...
  cross algo -> for any space encountered check if the next valid character ('0' or '1')
  downwars, upwards, left or right (if ocation exists) is a wall ('1') after skipping all adjacent spaces.  
- fill copy_map spaces with walls ('1')
- Check for any extraneous characters
- Check leaks for each problem, scenarios:
  - No map: OK
  - Trashed map: OK
  - Unclosed map: OK
